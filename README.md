This is simple QUIZ GAME. 

Program reads questions and answers from .txt file. User can define his own questions with any text editor. There's no question limit, so user can define as many questions as he wants.

It's first version of application. In future I will add model to define new questions and answers (now If user make a mistake in scheme <<Question-option1-option2-option3-option4-answer>>, program won't work properly, creating a specific module for this task should solve the problem).
